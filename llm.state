# File: llm.state
# Purpose: Persistent restoration snapshot summarizing TransformerEngine SM120
#          enablement work carried out in this session, including decisions,
#          tool usage, outstanding tasks, and next steps for rapid resumption.
# Related Files: 
#   - quants-dev.md (project implementation plan tracking)
#   - transformer_engine/common/gemm/cublaslt_gemm.cu (recent NVFP4/MXFP8 runtime updates)
#   - transformer_engine/pytorch/tensor/* (tensor metadata changes)
# Integration Points:
#   - Serves as a checkpoint for collaborators or the same agent after context
#     compaction to recover task state without re-reading commit history.
#   - Should be consulted before making further modifications to ensure
#     continuity with the documented plan.

## Summary Of Recent Progress
- Enabled SM120 capability probing and mapping for MXFP8/NVFP4 (runtime + PyTorch gating).
- Extended cuBLASLt GEMM path: SM120 compute modes, multi-heuristic fallback, NVFP4 alpha/beta staging, workspace enforcement in `nvte_cublas_gemm_v2`.
- Treated SM120 as SM10x in PTX feature gates to activate optimized inline assembly.
- Added block metadata (block size, scale dtype) to MXFP8/NVFP4 tensor storage and ensured construction paths propagate this information.
- Updated project plan (`quants-dev.md`) and marked JAX follow-up as optional.
- Plumbed `QuantizationConfig.block_size` validation into the MXFP8 and NVFP4 quantization entry points (checks only; CUDA kernels still assume fixed tiling while parameterization work continues under task 2).
- Refactored the NVFP4 quantization launch to instantiate block-size-specialized kernels (templated on the row block length) so future SM120 tuning can dispatch alternative tilings, and routed associated buffer math / dimension checks through that parameter.

## Tool Usage Log
- `sed`, `rg`, and `python` one-off scripts used for targeted inspections (no persistent side effects).
- `apply_patch` employed for all file edits, ensuring atomic changes per instruction.
- `git commit` executed after grouping logical changes; commits pushed to `dev-quant`.

## Outstanding Work Items
1. **CUDA Kernel Generalization**
   - Replace hard-coded MXFP8/NVFP4 block sizes (32/16) inside CUDA kernels, transpose helpers, and swizzle utilities with values derived from `QuantizationConfig.block_size` (NVFP4 quantize launch now templates block size; remaining device kernels/transposes still fixed).
   - Introduce SM120-specific inline assembly paths (e.g., `cvt.rp.satfinite.ue8m0x2.f32`) guarded by the new feature macro.
2. **PyTorch Framework Polish**
   - Extend master-weight casting to support ZeRO/FSDP sharded weights for MXFP8/NVFP4.
   - Remove legacy BF16 fallbacks in higher-level modules once runtime probes succeed.
   - Update distributed collectives to honor MXFP8/NVFP4 metadata; ensure scale tensors exchange correctly.
3. **Validation & Testing**
   - Add SM120-focused unit/integration tests: GEMM smoke tests, kernel correctness, distributed flows.
   - Confirm existing suites run cleanly with new metadata paths.
4. **Documentation & Release Prep**
   - Expand user-facing docs/examples describing SM120 requirements and configuration.
   - Prepare release notes enumerating MXFP8/NVFP4 enablement steps.
5. **Optional (Deferred)**
   - Mirror updates into the JAX stack once PyTorch path stabilizes.

## Next Suggested Actions
1. Audit CUDA kernels (starting with `common/util/cast_kernels.cuh` and `common/util/nvfp4_transpose.cuh`) to parameterize block sizes, updating host launch sites accordingly.
2. After kernel refactor, add targeted SM120 tests to verify new paths before touching framework layers.
3. Proceed with distributed/master-weight enhancements once kernel metadata flow is validated.
