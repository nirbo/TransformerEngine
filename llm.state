# Purpose: Persistent restoration snapshot summarizing TransformerEngine SM120
#          enablement work carried out in this session, including decisions,
#          tool usage, outstanding tasks, and next steps for rapid resumption.

# Integration Points:
#   - Serves as a checkpoint for collaborators or the same agent after context
#     compaction to recover task state without re-reading commit history.
#   - Should be consulted before making further modifications to ensure
#     continuity with the documented plan.

## Summary Of Recent Progress
- Enabled SM120 capability probing and mapping for MXFP8/NVFP4 (runtime + PyTorch gating).
- Extended cuBLASLt GEMM path: SM120 compute modes, multi-heuristic fallback, NVFP4 alpha/beta staging, workspace enforcement in `nvte_cublas_gemm_v2`.
- Treated SM120 as SM10x in PTX feature gates to activate optimized inline assembly.
- Added block metadata (block size, scale dtype) to MXFP8/NVFP4 tensor storage and ensured construction paths propagate this information.
- Updated project plan (`quants-dev.md`) and marked JAX follow-up as optional.
- Plumbed `QuantizationConfig.block_size` validation into the MXFP8 and NVFP4 quantization entry points (checks only; CUDA kernels still assume fixed tiling while parameterization work continues under task 2).
- Refactored the NVFP4 quantization launch to instantiate block-size-specialized kernels (templated on the row block length) so future SM120 tuning can dispatch alternative tilings, and routed associated buffer math / dimension checks through that parameter.
- Updated NVFP4 swizzle utilities to infer block sizes from tensor metadata instead of relying on the hard-coded 16 literal (retaining the existing layout while adding validation).
- Templated NVFP4 transpose kernels and host dispatchers on block size so SM120 metadata selects the appropriate instantiation while defaulting to the current 16-element tiling.
- Distributed NVFP4 all-gather now reads the tensorâ€™s block size metadata when slicing/padding scale buffers, so collective ops stay consistent with runtime configuration.
- Distributed MXFP8 all-gather mirrors the metadata usage, swapping the remaining literal block width for the tensor/quantizer-provided value.
- NVFP4/MXFP8 quantizers now surface their block-size setting so storage constructors and shape checks reuse the runtime metadata rather than hard-coded constants.
- Parameterized MXFP8 quantization kernels/launchers on compile-time block size template arguments so SM120 recipes rely on tensor metadata instead of literal 32-element assumptions.
- Reworked MXFP8/NVFP4 dequantization entry points into templated helpers that dispatch based on tensor metadata while validating supported tilings.
- Tensor wrappers now propagate block-size metadata from Python quantizers, ensuring newly created MXFP8/NVFP4 tensors immediately expose their configured tiling to the C++ runtime.
- `cast_master_weights_to_fp8` now reconstructs MXFP8/NVFP4 master weights under FSDP/ZeRO via all-reduce so sharded optimizers can update the quantized replicas without falling back to BF16.
- Distributed ZeRO/FSDP regression harness (`tests/pytorch/distributed/run_cast_master_weights_to_fp8.py`) now exercises MXFP8 and NVFP4 tensor types in addition to existing FP8 modes.

## Tool Usage Log
- `sed`, `rg`, and `python` one-off scripts used for targeted inspections (no persistent side effects).
- `apply_patch` employed for all file edits, ensuring atomic changes per instruction.
- `git commit` executed after grouping logical changes; commits pushed to `dev-quant`.

## Outstanding Work Items
1. **CUDA Kernel Generalization**
   - Implement SM120-specific inline assembly fast paths (e.g., `cvt.rp.satfinite.ue8m0x2.f32`) and audit remaining helpers for architecture gating/performance regressions.
2. **PyTorch Framework Polish**
   - Extend master-weight casting to support ZeRO/FSDP sharded weights for MXFP8/NVFP4.
   - Remove legacy BF16 fallbacks in higher-level modules once runtime probes succeed.
   - Update distributed collectives to honor MXFP8/NVFP4 metadata; ensure scale tensors exchange correctly.
3. **Validation & Testing**
   - Add SM120-focused unit/integration tests covering GEMM smoke paths, kernel correctness, and attention kernels (distributed cast-master-weights test now covers MXFP8/NVFP4 flows).
   - Confirm existing suites run cleanly with new metadata paths.
4. **Documentation & Release Prep**
   - Expand user-facing docs/examples describing SM120 requirements and configuration.
   - Prepare release notes enumerating MXFP8/NVFP4 enablement steps.
5. **Optional (Deferred)**
   - Mirror updates into the JAX stack once PyTorch path stabilizes.

## Next Suggested Actions
1. Add SM120 inline-asm coverage and verify the templated kernels still assemble correctly for Hopper/Pascal fallbacks.
2. After kernel hot paths settle, add targeted SM120 tests to verify new execution paths before touching framework layers.
3. Proceed with distributed/master-weight enhancements once kernel metadata flow is validated.
