Changes:
- Reused the templated NVFP4 block size when computing shared-memory buffer footprints and tensor layout constraints.
- Added explicit divisibility checks so the runtime fails fast if tensors are not compatible with the selected NVFP4 block length.
- Noted the tighter buffer usage in llm.state for resume context.

Testing:
- Not run (assertion-only update).
