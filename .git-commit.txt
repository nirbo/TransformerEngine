Parameterize NVFP4 transpose & swizzle block sizes

- template nvfp4 transpose kernels and host dispatcher on block size, wiring QuantizationConfig metadata into launch selection while preserving existing 16-element support
- add compile-time traits for shuffle/tile constants and dispatch through per-block-size helpers instead of hard-coded values
- ensure swizzle utilities derive NVFP4 block sizes from tensor metadata when sizing scale buffers to keep distributed paths aware of SM120 configurations
