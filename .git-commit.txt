Changes:
- Imported the MXFP8 block scaling constant into the distributed helpers and threaded block-size metadata through the all-gather path.
- Replaced the remaining literal 32 divisor with the resolved block size so columnwise scale buffers follow runtime configuration.
- Logged the MXFP8 metadata usage in llm.state.

Testing:
- Not run (metadata-only change).
