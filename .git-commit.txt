Title: Centralize MXFP8/NVFP4 block-size resolution

Summary:
- add transformer_engine/common/util/cast_kernels.cuh helper to merge
  QuantizationConfig overrides with tensor metadata when selecting block
  sizes for MXFP8/NVFP4 quantize paths
- update mxfp8/nvfp4 quantize entry points and the runtime dispatcher to use
  the shared helper so SM120 metadata stays consistent
- note the change in llm.state and quants-dev.md under the outstanding-kernel
  work section

Testing:
- not run (header-only refactor; requires multi-GPU CUDA environment)
