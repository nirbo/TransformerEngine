Changes:
- Added a helper in the swizzle utilities to infer NVFP4 block sizes from the tensor metadata and validate divisibility before launching the rowwise kernel.
- Replaced usages of the hard-coded NVFP4 block literal with the inferred value so the path honors QuantizationConfig-derived block lengths without altering existing layouts.
- Updated llm.state with the swizzle progress for continuity.

Testing:
- Not run (structural guard adjustments only).
