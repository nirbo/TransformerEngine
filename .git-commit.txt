Changes:
- Added a TensorWrapper helper to set the underlying tensor block size so Python quantizers can seed metadata directly.
- Ensured MXFP8/NVFP4 quantizers call the setter, keeping newly created tensors block-size aware before quantization runs.
- Noted the wrapper plumbing in llm.state.

Testing:
- Not run (API wiring only).
