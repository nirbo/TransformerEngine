Title: Guard SM120 builds on missing Blackwell intrinsics

Summary:
- add explicit <stdint.h> include + forward decls in transformer_engine.h to unblock
  TensorWrapper::set_block_size out-of-line definition
- move TensorWrapper::set_block_size implementation into
  transformer_engine/common/transformer_engine.cpp and fix block_size accesses
- wrap Blackwell-only cuBLAS compute enums behind preprocessor guards to fall
  back to CUBLAS_COMPUTE_32F when headers are older than CUDA 13
- prevent sm_120 toolchains from taking Hopper inline PTX path until the new
  instructions assemble

Testing:
- source venv/bin/activate
- pip install --no-build-isolation .
