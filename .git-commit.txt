Changes:
- Refactored NVFP4 quantization to instantiate block-size-specific kernels via a template parameter, plumbing the config-derived block length into the launch path.
- Adjusted the NVFP4 CUDA kernel signature to accept the block size as a compile-time argument and updated dispatch sites accordingly.
- Recorded the templated NVFP4 launch progress in llm.state for future resume context.

Testing:
- Not run (compile-time templating only; no runtime coverage added yet).
