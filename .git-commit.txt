Changes:
- Added a `block_size` field to the core tensor representation, clearing it during resets and populating it from quantization configs so the runtime retains block metadata.
- Updated host-side checks and dequantization helpers to consult the stored block size, validating expected scale shapes and gating the MXFP8/NVFP4 kernels on supported sizes.
- Captured the metadata-aware dequantization work in llm.state for continuity.

Testing:
- Not run (logic-only changes).
