Changes:
- Reworked MXFP8/NVFP4 master-weight casting so sharded (FSDP/ZeRO) optimizers reconstruct the full weight via all-reduce before quantizing, removing the previous NotImplemented paths.
- Kept legacy behaviour for fully-replicated master weights while sharing the updated code path.
- Noted the metadata-aware casting capability in llm.state.

Testing:
- Not run (depends on distributed runtime).
