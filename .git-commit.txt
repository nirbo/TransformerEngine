Changes:
- Imported the NVFP4 block scaling constant into the distributed helpers and used tensor metadata to determine the block size when preparing all-gather buffers.
- Replaced the remaining literal `16` in the NVFP4 scale gather path with the resolved block size so slicing respects runtime configuration.
- Logged the distributed metadata change in llm.state for continuity.

Testing:
- Not run (metadata-only adjustments).
