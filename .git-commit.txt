Changes:
- Validated MXFP8 block scaling metadata by pluming QuantizationConfig.block_size into the quantize path.
- Updated dispatcher calls so host code can forward configuration pointers or default to legacy behaviour.
- Refreshed llm.state with the new validation step and clarified outstanding kernel work.

Testing:
- Not run (in-progress refactor; kernels unchanged).
