Changes:
- Added `block_size` attributes to the MXFP8 and NVFP4 quantizers so shape checks and tensor factories reuse metadata instead of literals.
- Threaded those values through the respective tensor constructors, keeping the `_block_size` stored on tensor storage aligned with the quantizer setting.
- Updated the state log to record the quantizer metadata change.

Testing:
- Not run (metadata-only update).
