Changes:
- Reused the resolved NVFP4 block size when sizing shared-memory buffers in the transpose launch path so future block variants stay consistent.
- Kept the existing kernel layout intact by limiting the change to host-side bookkeeping, and documented the progress in llm.state.

Testing:
- Not run (buffer-sizing adjustment only).
